# Case Study: J.Crew and Nine West — Covenant Loopholes, Collateral Theft, and Liability Management

The J.Crew and Nine West cases illustrate how sophisticated borrowers exploit covenant loopholes to strip creditor protections — and how seemingly minor capital structure decisions during an LBO can create cascading problems in bankruptcy. These cases are the modern frontier of covenant analysis from the frameworks.

## J.Crew: The "Trap Door" Provision

### Background

J.Crew was acquired by TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners in a leveraged buyout. The company's debt was primarily term loans secured by substantially all assets, including the J.Crew brand trademarks valued at $347 million.

### The Maneuver (2017)

J.Crew executed one of the most controversial liability management transactions in modern credit history. The company exploited Section 7.02(t) of its 101-page credit agreement — a clause originally designed for overseas tax efficiency.

**Step-by-step:**
1. Created a restricted subsidiary that was not a "Loan Party" (not a guarantor or borrower under the credit agreement)
2. Transferred 72% of the J.Crew brand trademarks ($250 million in value) into this subsidiary
3. Used the Section 7.02(t) investment basket to push these assets further into an unrestricted subsidiary
4. Once in the unrestricted subsidiary, the trademarks were no longer collateral for the term lenders
5. J.Crew then used the now-unencumbered IP as collateral for new financing

**The result:** Term lenders who believed they had a first-priority security interest in J.Crew's most valuable assets found that collateral had been legally removed from their reach — without their consent.

### The Forced Exchange

With lenders now effectively unsecured on their most valuable collateral, J.Crew forced a prisoner's dilemma:
- Offered term lenders a three-day window to exchange at par
- Over 88% accepted partial repayment rather than hold now-unsecured claims
- The short deadline prevented lender coordination

**Covenant analysis framework application:** This case demonstrates why the covenant analysis framework emphasizes reading the actual document, not just the covenant summary. The "trap door" was buried in a dense investment basket clause that no standard covenant screen would flag. The administrative agent (Bank of America) consented to the collateral release, possibly fearing loss of future business from sponsor-owned borrowers.

### Chapter 11 Filing (May 2020)

J.Crew filed Chapter 11 converting $1.65 billion of debt into equity. Despite the conversion, term-loan lenders remained disadvantaged — they retained first-priority interest in remaining assets but had already lost access to the brand collateral that originally secured their loans.

### Post-J.Crew: "J.Crew Blockers"

After the J.Crew maneuver, lenders began inserting "J.Crew blocker" provisions into new credit agreements to prevent similar IP transfers. However, the Yale Law Journal analysis found most blockers proved only partially effective. Borrowers at Neiman Marcus, Cirque du Soleil, and PetSmart developed alternative workarounds, demonstrating an arms race between borrower creativity and lender protection.

## Nine West: The Butterfly Effect of Capital Structure Decisions

### The LBO Structure (2014)

Sycamore Partners acquired Jones Group and carved it into Nine West (burdened with significant debt) and other brands (which were spun off debt-free). The capital structure included a critical design choice that would prove catastrophic:

**The guarantee structure problem:** The Unsecured Term Loan received seniority not through a security interest in assets, but through subsidiary guarantees. This created parent-subsidiary entitlement disputes that no one anticipated at origination.

### Why This Matters: Structural Subordination Framework

Under the structural subordination framework, whether debt is guaranteed by subsidiaries or secured by subsidiary assets creates fundamentally different creditor rights in bankruptcy:

| Protection Type | In Normal Operations | In Bankruptcy |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Security interest in assets | Secured claim up to collateral value | Clear priority; collateral value sets recovery |
| Subsidiary guarantee | Unsecured claim at guarantor level | Guarantee may be voided as fraudulent conveyance |

Nine West's Unsecured Term Loan holders had guarantees, not liens. When the company filed, the guarantee structure created cascading disputes.

### The Bankruptcy Disputes ($140M+ in Professional Fees)

The guarantee-based priority structure generated three major disputes that consumed the estate:

**1. Intercompany claims:** Were $700 million in subsidiary-to-parent transfers loans or dividends? If loans, the subsidiaries had claims against the parent that competed with other unsecured creditors. If dividends, the transfers might be fraudulent conveyances. This is exactly the fraudulent conveyance risk from the distress investing risks framework.

**2. IP ownership:** Did intellectual property value belong to the parent (where the Unsecured Term Loan sat) or the subsidiaries (where the guarantees originated)? The answer determined which creditors could claim that value.

**3. Customer relationships:** The return of major customer Belk's business after Sycamore threatened termination showed how sponsor control could influence asset values during the case.

**Professional cost impact:** These disputes generated over $140 million in professional fees — 23% of Nine West's entire enterprise value. This is Truth #4 from the risks framework at its most extreme: restructuring costs consumed nearly a quarter of total value.

### The Broader Lesson

Nine West demonstrates a "butterfly effect" in credit structuring: small modifications to the financing structure at origination produced disproportionately large consequences during financial distress. The decision to use guarantees instead of liens was made for deal-execution convenience, but it created a legal morass that destroyed significant creditor value.

## Combined Lessons for Credit Investors

### 1. Read the Actual Documents
Standard covenant screens won't catch J.Crew-style trap doors. The investment basket, restricted payments basket, and permitted lien basket can interact in ways that create unintended (or intentional) loopholes. This is Truth #5 from the risks framework: creditors have only contractual rights — and those contracts may contain provisions that undermine their protections.

### 2. Evaluate Guarantee Quality, Not Just Existence
A bond with "subsidiary guarantees" is not necessarily well-protected. Assess: Are the guarantors well-capitalized (reducing fraudulent conveyance risk)? Do the guarantors hold the key assets? Could the guarantee structure create disputes in bankruptcy (the Nine West problem)?

### 3. Unrestricted Subsidiaries Are a Red Flag
Any entity designated as "unrestricted" sits outside the credit group. Assets can be moved there through permitted investment baskets. The J.Crew case shows this isn't theoretical — it happens. Always check `get_corporate_structure` for `is_unrestricted` entities.

### 4. Sponsor Creativity Increases in Distress
As companies approach distress, sponsor-backed borrowers become more creative with liability management transactions. J.Crew's maneuver, Neiman Marcus's collateral drops, and PetSmart's basket manipulation all occurred when companies were under financial pressure. Increasing sponsor activity near covenant thresholds is a warning sign.

### 5. Administrative Agent Incentives Are Misaligned
Bank of America consented to J.Crew's collateral release. Administrative agents may prioritize maintaining sponsor relationships over protecting term lenders. Don't rely on the agent to enforce your rights — monitor covenants independently.

### 6. Simple Capital Structures Reduce Bankruptcy Costs
Nine West's $140M+ in professional fees (23% of EV) resulted from a complex guarantee-based priority structure. Simpler capital structures (single-class secured debt with clear collateral) produce faster, cheaper bankruptcies with better recoveries. When evaluating two similar credits, prefer the one with the simpler capital structure.

## Medici Tools Application

When analyzing covenant and structural risks similar to J.Crew/Nine West:

- **`search_covenants`** — Check investment basket flexibility, restricted payment capacity, and permitted lien thresholds; wide baskets near covenant limits are warning signs
- **`get_corporate_structure`** — Identify `is_unrestricted` subsidiaries; assets there are beyond creditor reach
- **`get_guarantors`** — Assess guarantee coverage and guarantor financial health; guarantees from thinly-capitalized subs are unreliable
- **`search_documents`** — Search `query="unrestricted subsidiary"` or `query="investment basket"` to identify potential J.Crew-style risk; search `query="intercompany"` for Nine West-style transfer risk
- **`search_bonds`** — Compare `security_type` (first lien vs. unsecured with guarantees) and `has_guarantors` — secured claims with collateral are more reliable than unsecured claims with guarantees
